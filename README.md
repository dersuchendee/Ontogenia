# Ontogenia

## Overview
Ontogenia is a Python-based project focused on exploring ontology generation and management. This repository includes scripts and data essential for conducting complex query solutions and thematic ontology constructions.

## Repository Structure
- **code-basic-cqs.py**: Script for basic complex queries.
- **code-thematic-cqs.py**: Script for thematic complex queries.
- **data/**: Contains data files used in ontology processes.
- **outputs/**: Stores outputs from the scripts.
- **ontology_design.log**: Logs details of the ontology design process experiments.
- **thematic_groups.json**: JSON file containing thematic groups information.

### code-basic-cqs.py: Overview

#### Overview
This script is designed to automate ontology generation by integrating OpenAI's language model, data handling with pandas, and detailed logging. It facilitates the reading, processing, and application of competency questions (CQs) to generate ontologies using specific patterns and procedures.

#### Key Components
- **Data Reading**: Scripts read procedure texts and CQs from specified files.
- **Ontology Generation**: Utilizes OpenAI's API to generate ontologies based on the CQs provided, with the capability to split questions into groups for detailed processing.
- **Logging**: Tracks the process and outcomes of ontology generation using the `logging` module, saving logs to 'ontology_design.log'.
- **Output Management**: Outputs are written to .owl files, named dynamically based on the date and specifics of the CQs processed.

#### Workflow
1. **Initialize**: Read the procedure and patterns from text and CSV files.
2. **Process CQs**: Optionally split CQs into thematic groups.
3. **Generate Ontologies**: Create prompts from CQs, invoke the LLM to generate ontology sections, and log the responses.
4. **Compile and Save**: Concatenate generated ontology sections, save them in a structured OWL format file, and log the total token usage and process details.

#### Usage
To run the script, simply execute the main function with the desired settings for trial iterations and data paths. The script can handle different configurations such as only CQs, CQs with patterns, or procedure-based generation to accommodate various experimental setups.

### code-thematic-cqs.py Overview

#### Overview
This script facilitates ontology generation using OpenAI's GPT models. It processes and categorizes competency questions (CQs) from a string or CSV file, employs OpenAI's API to generate ontology segments, and compiles these into comprehensive .owl files while maintaining detailed logs.

#### Key Components
- **Import Modules**: Uses pandas for data handling, openai for AI interactions, and logging for process tracking.
- **Read Data**: Reads procedures and CQs from files, splitting CQs into thematic groups if needed.
- **Ontology Generation**: Constructs prompts from CQs and generates ontologies using structured interaction with an AI model.
- **Logging and Output**: Logs detailed information about the process and saves the generated ontology to a file.

#### Workflow
1. **Initialize and Read Data**: The script begins by reading necessary data and configurations.
2. **Process and Categorize CQs**: CQs are either read from a CSV or directly from a string and categorized into thematic groups.
3. **Generate Ontology**: For each group of CQs, a prompt is created and processed through the AI model to generate ontology data.
4. **Compile and Save Output**: Outputs from each group are compiled into a single file, logged, and saved in the designated output directory.

#### Execution
Execute the script by running the `main` function with the required configurations. The script supports multiple trials with different configurations for thorough testing and refinement of ontology generation.
